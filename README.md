# Work Day Scheduler

Want to be more productive with your workday? 
Look no further. 
This work day schedule presents the user with a display of the month, day, year, hour, minute, and second - updated every 1000ms.
Bootstrap was used in the HTML to create rows - each with a specific hour 9AM-5PM, 
an input field into which the user is prompted to "Type Here" - also color coded based on past/ present/ future and disabled if past, 
and a "Save" button that updates localStorage with the newly inputted, edited, or deleted task for a specific timeframe; this button (like the input field) is disabled once the time block has passed.
